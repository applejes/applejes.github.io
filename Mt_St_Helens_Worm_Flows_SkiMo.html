<p><strong>Logistics:</strong></p>

<ul><li>Please inform me about any corrections or updates to your personal information.</li><li>Contact me immediately if you need to cancel your spot on this climb.</li><li>Copy this prospectus and share with your emergency contacts, tell them your plans, the expected return time, and when to initiate a rescue effort.</li><li>Share your carpool plans with the team. Use the linked spreadsheet: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cUgFSgoamxeWgVVq_STy9SilQpYXPcvhI_17dljAQPo/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cUgFSgoamxeWgVVq_STy9SilQpYXPcvhI_17dljAQPo/edit?usp=sharing</a></li><li>We&#39;ll meet at the trailhead no later than 6:00 am. Allow at least one to 1½ hours drive time from Portland. Note: Hwy 503 is has lots of turns and deer crossings. There is a bathroom but no water.</li><li>Trailhead directions from Cougar: drive about 6-7 miles east on 503 and turn left on Forest Road 83 toward the Ape Cave. Follow FR 83, keeping right at the junction with FR 81. Continue on FR 83 a few more miles to the Marble Mountain Snow Park, approximately 13 miles East of Cougar. (Elevation 2,700ft)</li><li>Roundtrip mileage from Portland is about 160 miles. The suggested auto reimbursement contribution is 15 cents per mile, $24 per person to a maximum of $72 per car. The most dangerous part of the trip may well be the drive home, so please carpool for safety and take a nap if you need to.   </li></ul>

<p><strong>Permits / Fees (Trail, entrance, parking):</strong></p>

<ul><li>Between April 1st - October 31st, you must purchase a permit via <a href="http://www.mshinstitute.org" target="_blank">www.mshinstitute.org</a>. Permits are $22.00. Permits are limited to 500/day from April 1st - May 14th, and 100/day from May 15th - October 31st. Between Nov 1 and March 31 there is no quota and no climbing permit fee, but a self issued permit is required. Snow park permit required between Dec 01 and April 1. Sno-Park permits are not available for purchase at the trailhead.</li><li>A Washington Sno-Park Pass (not Oregon) is required. They can be purchased online through the State Park website (<a href="http://www.parks.state.wa.us" target="_blank">http://www.parks.state.wa.us</a>) or ranger stations and local retailers like REI <a href="http://www.parks.state.wa.us/147/Sno-Park-Permit-vendors" target="_blank">(http://www.parks.state.wa.us/147/Sno-Park-Permit-vendors</a>).</li></ul>

<p><strong>Climbing Skills Required:  </strong></p>

<ul><li>Up to 30deg snow travel on skis, ice axe, and crampon use. Anyone going on the climb must be in good condition. Those in poor shape may be turned back at the leader’s discretion.  If you have not climbed for awhile, you should get out your Freedom of the Hills book and review the &quot;Snow Travel / Climbing&quot; chapter. </li></ul>

<p><strong>Notes on the Gear List:</strong></p>

<ul><li>Make sure you have a decent set of --well fitting-- crampon-compatible ski boots. Blisters suck. Don&#39;t get blisters. I hate blisters. Nobody likes blisters. Especially when you can&#39;t wear normal shoes for weeks afterward. #notoblisters</li><li>Ski crampons may be useful if you have them.</li><li>I can provide a Mazamas-issued avalanche beacon, probe, and shovel if for some reason yours are not serviceable; however, it is expected that you have been trained to use them and are proficient. Let me know of you need to borrow these.</li><li>Don’t forget alkaline batteries for your beacon.</li><li>You can rent alpine touring gear, crampons, and an ice axe from Mountain Shop, Next Adventure, and REI.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Approach, climb, and descent:</strong></p>

<p>Try to keep your pack weight to 30lbs or less. We will check equipment and leave the trailhead no later than 7am.  We will be in the trees for about an hour, and then emerge from timberline, cross above Chocolate Falls, and start upwards slow and steady.  We’ll try to take a 5-10 minute break every 60-75 minutes, but not long enough to get cold. Plan on no longer than 5 min on the summit for photos, depending on weather. Descent will be by the same route.  The total ascent is approx. 5,500 feet. We should be back at the cars between 1:00-3:00 pm. Plan on stopping at a restaurant for dinner and summit certificates. Your assistance on researching a memorable place to eat on the way home is requested --except the pizza place in Woodland that has ranch sauce pizza. Gross.</p>

<p><strong>Fascinating Climb Regulations:</strong></p>

<ul><li>In case of accident, illness, or other incapacity, a climber must pay for his/her own medical and/or evacuation expenses, whether or not he/she has specifically authorized them.  Note that all Mazama members have rescue insurance.</li><li>Pets, firearms, alcoholic beverages and radios (other than ham radio transmitters or weather radios) are not permitted on climbs or in base camps.</li><li>No one will be permitted on the climb who has taken or used substances (including medication) which impairs performance or judgment.</li><li>Climbers shall carry out everything they carry in.  </li><li>Climbers 17 years of age or under must furnish the climb leader with a written parental or guardian permission slip.</li><li>Climbers 14 years of age or under must be accompanied on the climb by an adult responsible for them, who shall be required to remain with or descend with them.  Neither the leader nor the assistant leader of any climb shall be the responsible adult for a climber 14 years of age or younger. If the &quot;responsible adult&quot; descends, all climbers for whom he/she is responsible shall be required to descend as well.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Canc​ellation:</strong></p>

<p>Everyone monitor the weather and avalanche forecasts. The decision to cancel will be made in town no later than 5pm February 14th.  Be sure I have your correct phone number and check your e-mail messages often if the weather is questionable. I will send out a go/no go e-mail to all climbers to confirm either way.</p>

	<tr><td class="data"><br/><p><strong>Who:</strong></p>

<p>Intermediate-level experienced backcountry skier/split-boarder/climbers. &#39;Intermediate-level&#39; is defined as &quot;you can at least survival-ski down all the routes in-bounds at a typical resort, you&#39;ve been on some backcountry tours, and you&#39;ve mountaineered a thing or two.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>What:</strong></p>

<p>Worm Flows route, which means moderate slopes and likely variable conditions including icy patches and your favorite &quot;South Side Sastrugi&quot; we know and love on Cascade volcanos.</p>

<p><strong>Where:</strong></p>

<p>Mt. St. Helens.</p>

<p><strong>When:</strong></p>

<p>Next weather window in winter 2019 --most likely February. Since this is a winter climb the climb date is TBD. This will be a car-to-car climb leaving from Portland and returning the same day.</p>

<p><strong>Why:</strong></p>

<p>Because skis are better than snowshoes.</p>

<p><strong>Other Pertinent Details:</strong></p>

<p>Participants on this climb should have their own backcountry ski (alpine touring or telemark) or split-board setup, avalanche beacons, shovels, and probes; and have at least Mazamas SkiMo/ICS-level avalanche training --preferably Avy-I certified. You&#39;ll also need crampons and an ice axe (whippets if you know how to use them are ok). Ski crampons in addition get extra credit.</p></td></tr>

	<tr><td>Description</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="data"><p><b>Scheduled outside of paid permit seasons, Nov. 1–March 31.</b></p><p>This route is open year round from the Marble Mountain Snow Park, so it&#39;s usually used for early season ascents. It&#39;s about 1,000 more vertical feet than Monitor ridge. Snow can be soft early season due to the low starting elevation, so bring skis or snowshoes in case. St. Helens is one of the lower and technically easier glaciated peaks in the Pacific NW, but still a strenuous climb as the starting elevation is relatively low. The peak is often underestimated; exposure and route finding challenges in low visibility can make this peak a serious as any in the Northwest. <b>Watch out for the cornices on the summit crater!</b></p><p><b>﻿</b>This is a classic NW ski climb, with long open runs, minimal avy danger, and no crevasses. This can be a nice overnight trip as well - ski in, make camp, and hike up for some tele turns. Permits and Stuff: St Helens is one of the most heavily regulated peaks in the US. See the Gifford Pinchot National Forest web site for current permit regulations, SnoPark permit required between Nov 15 and April 30.</p></td></tr>
